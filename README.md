# Hyper-Parameters-Tuning
In my project, I have implemented hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of machine learning models. By systematically exploring various hyperparameter configurations, such as learning rates, regularization strengths, and the number of estimators, I was able to identify the most effective settings for each model. This process involved using techniques such as grid search, random search, and cross-validation to evaluate different combinations and improve model accuracy and generalization. The results of hyperparameter tuning significantly enhanced the model's performance, leading to more precise and reliable predictions.
